          <h2>2. Animal (2010)</h2>
          <h3>By Kesha</h3>
          <p class="albumbio">
            Animal is the debut studio album by American singer and songwriter
            Kesha. The album was released on January 5, 2010, by RCA Records.
            Kesha worked on the album with a variety of record producers and
            songwriters such as Lukasz "Dr. Luke" Gottwald, Benny Blanco, David
            Gamson, Greg Kurstin, Max Martin and others. Kesha had been
            recording demos for several years when one eventually ended up in
            the hands of Samantha Cox, senior director of writer/publisher
            relations at BMI. Cox passed along the demo and it ended up in the
            hands of Gottwald, who decided to have Kesha perform on the song
            "Right Round" with American rapper Flo Rida. Within two months, the
            song became a hit in multiple countries around the world. The event
            led to Kesha being sought after by many major labels, and she
            eventually signed a multi-album deal with RCA Records.

            her third studio album, Visions; however, for unknown reasons, she
            scrapped most of the material from these sessions and began a new
            set of recordings in 2014. The track "Realiti", which came from the
            earlier recordings, was released as a demo in early 2015.

            singer-songwriter Lorde. It was released on 16 June 2017 by Lava and
            Republic Records and distributed through Universal. Following the
            breakthrough success of her debut album Pure Heroine (2013), Lorde
            retreated from the spotlight, and travelled between New Zealand and
            the United States. Initially inspired by her disillusionment with
            fame, she wrote Melodrama to capture heartbreak and solitude after
            her first breakup.

            recording, and subsequently transitioned from the new wave musical
            styles seen throughout her debut studio album, The Family Jewels
            (2010). Their efforts resulted in a concept album consisting of
            electropop and dance-pop music, a distinct departure from her
            earlier projects. Lyrically, the album discusses topics of love and
            identity. Diamandis created the title character "Electra Heart" to
            represent female archetypes in popular American culture (House Wife,
            Beauty Queen, Homewrecker, and Idle Teen).
